##  Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern and scalable technology stack to simulate a full-featured booking platform like Airbnb. Below are the core technologies used and their purposes:

###  Django
- **Purpose:** A high-level Python web framework used to develop robust backend systems and RESTful APIs. It simplifies database operations, request handling, and user authentication.

###  MySQL
- **Purpose:** A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage structured data such as user accounts, listings, and booking information efficiently.

###  GraphQL
- **Purpose:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It enhances flexibility and performance in frontend-backend communication.

###  Docker
- **Purpose:** A containerization platform used to create consistent development and production environments. It ensures portability and easy deployment of the application.

###  Git & GitHub
- **Purpose:** Version control tools used for source code management and team collaboration. GitHub also hosts the repository and enables CI/CD integrations.

###  GitHub Actions
- **Purpose:** A CI/CD platform that automates workflows such as testing, building, and deployment whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

###  Markdown
- **Purpose:** A lightweight markup language used for creating project documentation files such as `README.md`, enabling clear and readable formatting.

##  Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that simulate real-world functionality of a property rental platform. Each feature contributes to building a full-stack, scalable web application with real-life use cases.

###  User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports different user roles (host or guest), enabling customized experiences based on the user type.

###  Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes detailed information such as title, description, location, images, and price per night, helping users make informed booking decisions.

###  Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and make reservations by selecting check-in and check-out dates. The booking system prevents double bookings and ensures accurate availability tracking.

###  Review System
After completing a stay, guests can leave ratings and written reviews for properties. This feedback helps future guests evaluate options and promotes trust and accountability.

###  Payment Integration
Secure payment processing allows users to pay for bookings online. The system records transaction details and ensures each booking has a confirmed payment before finalizing.

###  Authentication and Security
All users are authenticated before accessing protected routes. Security measures like password hashing, token-based authentication, and data validation protect the application from common vulnerabilities.

###  Admin Dashboard (Optional)
An administrative interface allows project administrators to oversee users, properties, and bookings. This dashboard can help manage reports, disputes, or fraudulent activities efficiently.

###  API Architecture
The backend exposes a structured API (REST or GraphQL) that supports interaction between the frontend and database. The API is designed for scalability, reusability, and secure communication.

###  CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Automated workflows using GitHub Actions or similar tools handle testing, building, and deploying the application. This ensures reliable updates and maintains application integrity during development.
